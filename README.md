# GSR Support Agent — Multi-Agent Customer Support (Voice + Text)

A multi-agent customer support system for **GSR (GlobalShop Retail)**, a
fictional e-commerce company built for this project. Customers chat or
speak to the agent about orders, returns, billing, and account issues; a
LangGraph multi-agent pipeline routes each request to a specialist agent,
which answers using RAG (for policy questions) or real tool calls via a
custom MCP server (for account-specific data like order status).

## Status
🚧 Phase 1 in progress: synthetic operational data + RAG knowledge base.

## Why this exists
Support teams answer the same handful of question types constantly (where's
my order, how do I return this, why was I charged twice) while genuinely
novel or sensitive issues (account security, disputes) need a human. This
project builds a tiered system: specialist agents resolve routine issues
end-to-end using real data, and escalate to a human with full context when
they can't.

## Two distinct data sources (same principle as our earlier BI project)
1. **Operational data** (`data/raw/` → DuckDB) — customers, orders,
   payments, returns, tickets. Queried live via MCP tools. Never guessed,
   never retrieved via RAG.
2. **Knowledge base** (`knowledge_base/`) — policy and FAQ documents
   (returns, shipping, billing, warranty, account/security). Retrieved via
   RAG to ground policy answers.

## Architecture

```
Voice/Text input
      │
Voice I/O layer (STT/TTS) -- stateless, separate from agent logic
      │ text
FastAPI (async)
      │
LangGraph multi-agent pipeline:
  identify_customer → classify_intent → specialist agent
  (order_status | returns_refund | product_qa | billing | account)
  → resolution_check → respond OR escalate_to_human
      │
Custom MCP Server: get_order_status | get_customer_profile |
  check_return_eligibility | initiate_refund | create_support_ticket |
  update_ticket | escalate_to_human | send_notification |
  register_new_customer
      │
DuckDB (operational data) + Chroma/pgvector (policy RAG index)
      ▲
Real-time signup webhook -- new customers are queryable immediately,
no batch delay
```
